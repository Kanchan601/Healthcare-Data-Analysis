# Healthcare Data Analytics Dashboard
## Project Overview

- This project focuses on analyzing hospital and patient data to uncover meaningful insights that support better decision-making, resource optimization, and improved patient outcomes.
- Using tools like Excel, Power BI, Tableau, and MySQL, this analysis highlights key performance indicators (KPIs) across patients, doctors, visits, and financial metrics to create an end-to-end healthcare analytics solution.

## Objectives

- Build interactive dashboards in Excel, Power BI .
- Generate insights from healthcare KPIs such as patient count, doctor workload, follow-up rates, and treatment costs.
- Identify top diagnosed conditions, financial efficiency, and resource utilization trends.
- Demonstrate the power of data-driven healthcare management.

## Key Insights

- Served 10,000 patients with 1,000 doctors, maintaining a balanced patient-to-doctor ratio.
- Identified Top 5 Diagnosed Conditions for targeted preventive care.
- Analyzed Follow-up Rates to improve continuity of care.
- Evaluated Average Treatment Costs and Total Collections to assess financial performance.
- Explored Abnormal Lab Results trends for proactive intervention.
